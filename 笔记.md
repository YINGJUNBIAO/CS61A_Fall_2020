## function 
expression:  describes a computation and evaluates to a value  
all expressions can use function call notation  
everything could be expressed using a call expression  
```
python ok --local
python ok -q function_name --local
```

operator (operand) 
ops are also expressions: number 2 is an exp 
procedure: 
1 evaluate the operator and then the operand subexp 
2 apply the function that is the value of the operator subexpression to the arguments that are the values of the operand subexpression 

## lab 
```
python -i demo.py
Ctrl-D for MAC/linux
ctrl-z-Enter for window
python ok -q short-circuit -u --local
python ok -q debugging-quiz -u --local


```
Q4 
Python的assert是用来检查一个条件，如果它为真，就不做任何事。如果它为假，则会抛出AssertError并且包含错误信息,可以包含在源代码中
Python has a feature known as an assert statement, which lets you test that a condition is true, and print an error message otherwise in a single line. This is useful if you know that certain conditions need to be true at certain points in your program. For example, if you are writing a function that takes in an integer and doubles it, it might be useful to ensure that your input is in fact an integer. You can then write the following code

```
def double(x):
    assert isinstance(x, int), "The input to double(x) must be an integer"
    return 2 * x

```

'answer': 'Code that returns a wrong answer instead of crashing is generally better as it at least works fine',
it is generally better for code to crash than produce an incorrect result

## Control
Control structures direct the flow of a program using logical statements. 
For  example, conditionals (if-elif-else) allow a program to skip sections of code, and iteration (while), allows a program to repeat a section.
statement: define assignment, is executed by interpreter to perfrom an action 

False in python: value False 0 '' None 

iteration


prime factorization 
```
python -m doctest .\demo.py


```
用两个函数是因为harder to read 
一个函数用一个功能
