## function 
expression:  describes a computation and evaluates to a value  
all expressions can use function call notation  
everything could be expressed using a call expression  
```
python ok --local
python ok -q function_name --local
```

operator (operand) 
ops are also expressions: number 2 is an exp 
procedure: 
1 evaluate the operator and then the operand subexp 
2 apply the function that is the value of the operator subexpression to the arguments that are the values of the operand subexpression 

## lab 
```
python -i demo.py
Ctrl-D for MAC/linux
ctrl-z-Enter for window
python ok -q short-circuit -u --local
python ok -q debugging-quiz -u --local


```
Q4 
Python的assert是用来检查一个条件，如果它为真，就不做任何事。如果它为假，则会抛出AssertError并且包含错误信息,可以包含在源代码中
Python has a feature known as an assert statement, which lets you test that a condition is true, and print an error message otherwise in a single line. This is useful if you know that certain conditions need to be true at certain points in your program. For example, if you are writing a function that takes in an integer and doubles it, it might be useful to ensure that your input is in fact an integer. You can then write the following code

```
def double(x):
    assert isinstance(x, int), "The input to double(x) must be an integer"
    return 2 * x

```

'answer': 'Code that returns a wrong answer instead of crashing is generally better as it at least works fine',
it is generally better for code to crash than produce an incorrect result

## Control
Control structures direct the flow of a program using logical statements. 
For  example, conditionals (if-elif-else) allow a program to skip sections of code, and iteration (while), allows a program to repeat a section.
statement: define assignment, is executed by interpreter to perfrom an action 

False in python: value False 0 '' None 

iteration


prime factorization 
```
python -m doctest .\demo.py


```
用两个函数是因为harder to read 
一个函数用一个功能


## higher-order Function 
a function that 
takes a function as an arg value or 
returns a function as a return value 
```
def apply_twice(f,x): #take function as an arg 
    return f(f(x))
def square(x):
    return x*x

```
return 是关键字，不是函数，因此其后面的括号不是必须的；加括号易于阅读程序代码，有误括号不影响运行结果。
1. F are called, introducing a new frame, figure out what apply is, figure out what square is 
2. bind formal para (f & x) to arg 
3. exe the body: return f(f(x)), which is the body 0.0 
how to know f(f(x)) is: find them in Frame 


```
def repeat(f,x):
    while f(x) != x :
        x = f(x) 
    return x 

def g(y):
    return (y+5) // 3 
```


exe the body: 
1) eval the expression in the header of while statement -> T or F, f(x)框架, frame里的是全局的g函数
2) call f again, f(x) evals to 2, x evaluates to 3 


retuern 了 这个函数frame就消失了 原来

## env for Nested Defination
```
def make_adder(n):
    def adder(k):
        return k+n
    return adder


```
how is that we have a function that has data within it? 
the adder is in the 第二个 local frame里
牛逼
what a return statement does is: it brings info from a local frame back into the frame
that was the current frame when we call this F in the 1st place 

def 和 = 感觉都是在globle搞事情 

call adder, its parent is f1, 就是已经被消除的那个frame, 被消除的f1的parent 是global
 
when a function is defined:
Create a function value: func<name>(<formal para>) [parent = <parent>] #3 个 <>
parent is the current frame
bind <name> to the function value in the current frame 

when a function is called:
1. add a local frame, titled with <name> of the function being called 
2. copy the parent of the function to the local frame 
3. Bind the <formal para> to the arg in the lcoal 
4. exe the body of the F in the env that starts with the local frame 





local names 
```
def f(x,y):
    return g(x) 
def g(a):
    return a + y 
error 
```
# lambda 
expressions are exp that eval to functions 
就像我上面说的 def 和 =, def可以不强制哦
```
lambda x: x* x 

```
    
    
a function with formal para x that returns the value of 'x*x'
no return keyword in lambda 
a single expression without return 

	
	
difference between def and lambda:
	the def gives the func an intrinsic name 
    

    
self reference 
非常复杂 
没啥意义

function currying
